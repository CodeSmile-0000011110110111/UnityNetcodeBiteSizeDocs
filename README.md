# Learn how to Netcode

I'm the type that documents the essence and provides examples that work well in actual game development, favoring to implement the recommended solution. I also tend to try and work out every detail of a given aspect before moving on, and often adding useful stuff anyone will need to have anyway.

I'm also here and sharing what I learn because I see merit in providing paid assets for Netcode, and possibly other networking solutions - primarily [Fish-Net](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fish-net-networking-evolved-207815) because I hear such good things about it.&#x20;

So I'm very interested in an audience asking questions. This fuels my inspiration and motivation, and eventually I'll find the right assets which you like to pay for, so I can pay my bills sometime into 2024. Yes, I'm planning long-term.

Be sure to [join my Discord channel](https://discord.gg/56zUz3ZHUJ) or reach out to me on the Unity forum (link follows).

Lastly, the following link is the repository with the Unity project documented on these pages:
